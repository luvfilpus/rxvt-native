This is simply a copy of xpm-nox-4.2.0 from the 
cygwin distribution.  We need a static library, 
compiled as NO_X, BUT we can't include simx.o 
in the library, because it contains symbols that
would clash with libWll.

Therefore, we don't use /usr/lib/noX/* or /usr/include/noX/
but instead roll-our-own library and link it in statically to
rxvt.
