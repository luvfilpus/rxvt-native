<p align="center"><img src="rconf.gif" alt="RConf screenshot" width="645" height="464"></p>
<p>RConf is a configuration tool for Rclock - the xclock replacement that
comes with the <a href="http://www.rxvt.org/">Rxvt</a> terminal emulator.
Rclock features a memo facility, and RConf is a means to configure it.</p>
<p>To make RConf as portable as possible, it relies on nothing more than the
Athena widget toolkit which is included in most installs of the X Window system.
It's not the prettiest GUI toolkit in the world, but it gets the job done.</p>
