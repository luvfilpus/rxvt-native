This is my half-assed port to cygwin64. I'm not a programmer, just addicted to rxvt. 

This repo was created after using the cygport program to prep/configure the source.

If this ever works, I will create a proper cygport package which includes the changes,
I promise, but is not worth the hassle at this point.

The main change, done by me, is changing the cygwin path conversion function call due
to the fact that the function used in the 32bit cygwin is deprecated and not included
in the 64bit libraries. 

The part that I'm thus far too stupid to figure out is an undefined reference to 
XDeleteProperty. Since the output of this code will run properly under cygwin X but 
will not exec the shell in native mode, I suspect that the XDeleteProperty problem
is related.

I've updated autoconf's config.[guess,sub] so that they will work with cygwin64 and
made some changes to the Makefiles (but not Makefile.in, yet) so the make will proceed 
without errors.

As always, YMMV...
